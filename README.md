# Libertas Products : P2P file sender/receiver
Here's the full repository to the P2P file sender and receiver for Windows.<br>
This projects GUI is supported by the .NET Framework version 4.8 which is a proprietary shit but I can't do anything about it since it is the fastest way for me to create a usable GUI for the user. 
<br><br>
This code might be bloaded with useless bits of code since I have problem with concentration and I lose it over many letters of code being on my screen for hours.<br><br>
I made it in 1 month of research and development without really sleeping much and it was really hard to concentrate on it, so please appreciate it and give it a try, the full tutorial is a bit down there.
<br><br>Please remember that I will not be really active to fix bugs or add some functions because I am a student and I want to graduate, but I'll try to be as active as possible.<br><br>
